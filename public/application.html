    <h2>Summary</h2>
    Working on this Task i had completed all Activity. Activities talk about IOT application and its features in smart building.<br>
    IOT Apllication and smart building talk about what it is, what are its features and examples whereas control interface talks about users and parts needed.<br>
    they all together will help in making a Smart Building<br>
    also, we made our first practical task that used HTML and CSS.the practical Task was helpful in starting my journey as full stack developer with HTML and CSS.<br>
    we worked on the heading, spaces, paragraph, fonts and colour.<br>
